## Utility & Layout

### `ResizablePanel`
Draggable panel with resize handles
- Remembers size in localStorage

### `GridLayoutBuilder`
Drag-and-drop grid layout editor

- Command history
- Matches your retro aesthetic from `PaintCanvas`

### `APIStatusCard`
Service health monitoring widget
- Real-time status updates

## Implementation Priorities

**High Priority** (build on existing patterns):
1. `MorphingShape` - extends your animation experience
2. `ResizablePanel` - builds on `PaintCanvas` dragging
3. `MiniChart` - uses existing recharts dependency

**Medium Priority** (new but complementary):
1. `SpectrumVisualizer` - extends audio components
2. `CommandPalette` - enhances existing search
3. `NotificationToast` - useful across all components

**Low Priority** (nice to have):
1. `HeatmapCalendar` - data visualization
2. `TerminalWindow` - aesthetic fit
3. `GridLayoutBuilder` - advanced utility

## Architecture Notes

- All components should follow your existing patterns:
  - Client components with `"use client"`
  - shadcn/ui base components
  - tailwind-merge for conditional classes
  - TypeScript interfaces for props
- Maintain your gradient and glass-morphism aesthetic
- Use your existing color palette and spacing system
- Consider mobile responsiveness in all designs
